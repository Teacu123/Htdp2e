Design recipe for world program consists of 4 steps.

(1) identify the properties of the world that remain the same
over time. We call these constants. There are to kinds of
constants

I Physical constants
- describe general attributes of objects in the world
- e.g height of an object, velocity of object

II Graphical constants
- a composition of images that represent the complete
state of the world
- to develop such constants, use the interaction area
to make images until you find one that looks nice.

(2) Develop a data representation for all possible states of
the world. This is where you supply a data definition.
It should be clear how
a) information can be represented as data
b) data can be interpreted about the real world

(3) Design wish list of function.
You can use the template below to for this wishlist
and adopt it your program. Remember, each wish list entry
consists of a signature and purpose statement. Usually,
you will start with

a) render (maps world state to image)
b) clock-tick-handler
c) keystroke-handler
d) moust-event-handler
e) end? (what state of the world means progarm should end)

(4) design a main function. Its sole purpose is to launch
the world program.

Almost every world program you write
will have the functions below.

When you design new world programs you should use this template
changing the data definitions to suit the needs of your
problem.
