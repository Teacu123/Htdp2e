# Solutions and Demonstrations for HTDP/2e

These are my solutions for the 2nd edition of 
[How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/index.html)

I have a pacing guide for completing this book as well
as other resources at the following link.

Some of the demos are my own some are copied straight out of the book.
All solutions are my own work.
